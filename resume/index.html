        <p>Hello Everybody! Let me tell you something.</p>
        <p>See black &amp; white Indian kid to the left? That would be me. My unusual name (to most people) is actually pronounced as “<a href="http://www.thenamemeaning.com/faizal/" target="_blank">Faisal</a>”. I’m Faizal Shaikh and live mainly in the Vancouver Island these days. I spend my summer in Toronto, winter in India and travel when I can.</p>
        <p>I started working on the Web many years ago. Since then, I write for smart people. No cheesy stuff. I have been creating clean, elegant, and creative design for the web. I work hard to write code that add value and make it worth your time (even when the codes are long). I've worked on everything from Video Effects and Stop-Motion Animation to Graphics and Web Design and also Mobile Applications and Gaming.</p>
        <p>I have learned and tried to master languages such as PHP, ROR and tried new technologies like SASS, Jade, HAML, Jekyll, Gulp and much more. I've also worked with many of the popular CMS (content-management system) such as WordPress and Drupal.</p>
        <p>Through my experiences on the Internet, I've come to meet some of the most talented people, who taught me much. When I design, I strive for excellence and always try to be unique and push the boundaries. So now you know a bit about me. Check out my portfolio, or if you are really interested, shoot me an <a href="mailto:faizal@msbsindia.com">email</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to look and hopefully you enjoy.</p>

            <p>Icon Infosys has inspired and challenged me in ways I never expected. Here I have designed softwares and tools professionals use to enhance their productivity.

            <p>For fun, I added a voting function to the app, so the funniest facts can receive the credit that they deserve.</p>

            <p>For my ROR project, I built an application that I designed forever ago, but didn’t have the knowledge to build. So I thought it was fitting that I build it for my final ROR Project!</p>
            <p>It is an artwork sharing site, similar to dribbble, where a user can sign up and share what is inspiring them. So a user can add posts with title, image &amp; description, and other users can vote &amp; comment on submissions.</p>
